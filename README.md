Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## The Dashboard
The dashboard created is made up of a pulldown menu to select subjects by their IDs, a "Demographic Info" display with metadata about the subject, a horizontal bar chart consisting of the top 10 microbes found, a bubble chart that displays the OTU ID vs the sample values with bubble size and color based on the size of the sample value, and a gauge chart that shows the frequequency of belly button washing. When a subject selection is made from the pulldown menu all the charts and info are updated to reflect that subjects data.

A live version of the dashboard page can be found at https://sistre.github.io/plot_ly-challenge/.
